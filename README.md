# .dotfiles
Unix dotfiles which make things more awesome.

To use these yourself clone into ~/.dotfiles and run dotfiles-setup.zsh by running this command.

    git clone git://github.com/SarenCurrie/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && ~/.dotfiles/dotfiles-setup.zsh

Uses [oh-my-zsh] (https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) which is super awesome and requires [zsh] (http://www.zsh.org/) to work.

Works really well on [iTerm] (http://iterm2.com) on OS X and quite well with [guake terminal] (http://guake.org) on Linux.
